# Traffic Sign Recognition

This project is a Traffic Sign Classification system using a TensorFlow Lite model. It allows users to upload images of traffic signs and classify them using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## Features
- Upload an image to classify traffic signs.
- Uses a TensorFlow Lite model for efficient inference.
- Deployable with Streamlit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahaffayez/Traffic_Sign_Recognition.git
   cd Traffic_Sign_Recognition
## Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

 
## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

## Model

The model used is a TensorFlow Lite version of a CNN trained on the German Traffic Sign dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), available on Kaggle.
